# Fake Shop

This application was created from a react redux tutorial. The created application consits in a page with all the possible products to buy, showing an image, the title and the price. After getting the list, the buyer may press on one of the items in order to see some more details such as a description.

To get the products the Fake shop API was used, this API allows us to get all the shop's products as well as each product's details. To call the API we used axios.
